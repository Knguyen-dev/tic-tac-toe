# tic-tac-toe
Create a tic-tac-toe game. Write the code using factories, modules, and as little global code as possible.

Lesson learned: When you want to access some values or variables across multiple functions. It's a good idea to create modules. Here we used IIFE, which returned modules. First one was gridInfo, which helped since it ran some code to create the html that's needed when user loads in, and then it keeps important html elements like the grid element and the squares for the grid which we could use later. We also used a "factory", but it's really just a function to create player objects. The second one was the gameInfo IIFE, which ran code to create player objects, and initiate our starting values for the program. And then it returns those values as a 'module' or object and we could access those values later. And these are all in the private, and not global scope which helped organized the program a lot more. Use this technique of modules when you have a lot of common or related values you want to group together.
