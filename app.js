/*
- Store gameboard as an array inside Gameboard object. Players are also going to be stored
in objects, and have an object to control hte flow of the game itself.

- Have a little global code as possible. If you only need one of something such as 
a gameboard, or displayController, then use a module. If you need multiple of something,
such as players, create them with factories

- Write a function that renders the contents of the gameboard array, filling the 
arrays with things such as x's and o's
- Writes functions that let players add marks to specific spots on the board, then link
it to the DOM, letting the players click on spots on the boards. Don't forget to check
if a spot on the board was already used.

- Of course spend time first to think about where each function would go so that it all fits together

- Write function or logic that checks when the game is over. Checks for when it's a 3 in a row (win) or 
a tie

- Let the players put htier names, have a button to already start/restart the game
- Add a display element that congratulates the winning player 

- Optional Challenge: Create an AI so that hte player can play against computer
1. Start with having it make simple moves
2. Work on making it smart, you can create an AI using minimix algorithm. You should google 
this one.
